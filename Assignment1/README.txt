Assignment 1

Organiziation: Each question is contained in it's own file following the specified naming scheme: Question<num>.py or Question<num>.txt where <num> is the question number. As it was requested that our answers be in pdf form, each .txt file has also been saved as a .pdf file for the grader's convenience (though looking at the text files may be easier). Any assumptions I made for my code & answers have been documented in the .txt and .py files instead of the README file. This makes it easier for the grader to see the code & questions that the assumptions correspond to.

System Operation: I was running all unix commands on a Mac running OS X 10.11 El Capitan. All python code was compiled and run using Python 3.5.2.
